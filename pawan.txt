Hello! My name is Pawan Verma and I belong to Kothri.
 I’ve completed my first year from Rajiv Gandhi College and currently I’m pursuing Full Stack Development from Cybrom Institute. 
 My family consists of six members:
  my father is a farmer, my mother is a homemaker,
   I have one elder sister, and my grandfather and grandmother live with us.
    My strengths are quick learning and teamwork, while my weakness is overthinking.
     My hobbies include playing football and travelling to hill stations.
