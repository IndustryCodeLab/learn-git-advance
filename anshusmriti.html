Good morning everyone.
Today, I would like to share that we are being taught by Mr. Anshu Pandey Sir, who is a professional Software Engineer. He has excellent knowledge and experience in the software development field. Recently, he introduced us to Git, which is a version control system used by developers to manage code efficiently. He explained its concepts in a very simple and practical way.

Now, he is going to teach us about SDLC, which stands for Software Development Life Cycle. This topic will help us understand how software is planned, developed, tested, and delivered step by step. We are really excited to learn more under his guidance.
